MAIN6
-Added "load amount" to circles being sent from processes. It's the only way of ensuring we know exactly how much charge each of those circles are carrying and passing on.
-Created a "type" value within the text field on the process numbers box as I can multiples types of text within the same group. Should mean that I can differentiate them without this gettings too crazy.

MAIN5
-Stopped the enlarging for the momement as it's not the main focus
-Now have a "load" value that get's ticked through as the process runs
-'load' valus is altered using an 'output' value representing how much data can be sent at one time
-DONE -Need to make the output check that that much load can be passed. Create a "packet" value that will say how much data is actually being sent over

MAIN2
-Created a method that send off nodes (yellow circles) after each process position has pumped it out. 
-The next process isn't triffered until it receives information

MAIN3
-Changed the method so receiving data nodes increases the size of the process blocks
